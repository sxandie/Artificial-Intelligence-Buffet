\begin{itemize}
    \item Machine learning is a subfield of computer science.
    \item It focuses on building algorithms that rely on a collection of examples of some phenomenon.
    \item These examples can be sourced from nature, handcrafted by humans, or generated by another algorithm.
    \item Machine learning involves:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Gathering a dataset.
        \item Algorithmically building a statistical model based on that dataset.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The statistical model is assumed to be used to solve a practical problem.
\end{itemize}
